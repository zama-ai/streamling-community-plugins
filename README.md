# Streamling Community Plugins

Community-maintained plugins for [Streamling](https://github.com/goldsky-io/streamling).

## How to Use

Build the plugins as a shared library (`cargo build --profile release-optimized --lib`) or download a pre-built release from the GitHub releases page. 
Then set the `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__PATH` environment variable to the path of the compiled `.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll` file and run `streamling` as usual.

## Available Plugins

### S3 Sink (`s3_sink`)

Writes data as Parquet files to S3-compatible storage. Supports optional Hive-style partitioning.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__S3_SINK__<KEY>` environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `bucket` | yes | S3 bucket name |

| `allow_http` | no | Allow plain HTTP (auto-detected from `endpoint`) |
| `partition_columns` | no | Comma-separated column names for Hive partitioning |
| `max_concurrent_partition_uploads` | no | Max parallel partition uploads (default: 16) |

### MySQL Sink (`mysql_sink`)

Writes to MySQL with upsert/delete (CDC) support. Rows with `_gs_op = "d"` are deleted; all others are upserted.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__MYSQL_SINK__<KEY>` environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `host` | yes | — | MySQL host |
| `port` | no | `3306` | MySQL port |
| `user` | yes | — | MySQL user |
| `password` | yes | — | MySQL password |
| `database` | yes | — | Database name |
| `table` | yes | — | Target table (auto-created if missing) |
| `primary_key` | no | — | Comma-separated PK columns for upsert/delete |

| `batch_size` | no | `1000` | Max rows per INSERT statement |

### SQS Sink (`sqs`)

Sends each row as a JSON message to an AWS SQS queue. Handles SQS 10-message batch limits and retries partial failures.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__SQS_SINK__<KEY>` environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `queue_url` | yes | SQS queue URL |
| `region` | no | AWS region override |
| `endpoint_url` | no | Custom SQS endpoint (e.g. LocalStack) |
| `access_key_id` | no | AWS access key (env var preferred) |
| `secret_access_key` | no | AWS secret key (env var preferred) |
| `session_token` | no | STS session token (env var preferred) |

Example pipeline: [`examples/pipeline-sqs-sink.yaml`](examples/pipeline-sqs-sink.yaml)

### S2 Sink (`s2_sink`)

Appends each row as a JSON record to a stream on [s2.dev](https://s2.dev) — a durable streaming service — via the `s2-sdk` Producer. Rows are JSON-serialized and submitted to the Producer, which batches them internally; checkpoint markers drain pending record tickets, so the dispatcher only acknowledges a checkpoint after S2 has durably appended every record submitted before it. Each record carries a Debezium-style `dbz.op` header with the row kind, like the built-in Kafka sink; the `_gs_op` column is stripped from record bodies. Delivery is at-least-once — ambiguous append retries and checkpoint replay can duplicate records.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__S2_SINK__<KEY>` environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `access_token` | yes | — | S2 access token (env var preferred) |
| `basin` | yes | — | S2 basin name (must already exist) |
| `stream` | one of | — | Fixed S2 stream name within the basin |
| `stream_template` | one of | — | Per-row stream name with `{column}` placeholders (e.g. `events/{tenant}`); streams are created lazily as names resolve |
| `ensure_stream` | no | `true` | Create target streams if missing (idempotent). Disable if the token only has append scope, or when the basin has `create_stream_on_append` enabled (the natural pairing for `stream_template`) |
| `endpoint` | no | — | Custom S2-compatible endpoint URL (e.g. for s2-lite) |
| `request_timeout_ms` | no | `5000` | Per-request HTTP timeout (ms) |
| `linger_ms` | no | `5` | How long the Producer waits for more records before flushing a partial batch (ms) |

### S2 Source (`s2_source`)

Reads records from streams on [s2.dev](https://s2.dev) into Arrow batches, tailing each stream over a long-lived read session; with `stream_prefix`, newly created streams are picked up automatically. Emits either the raw record envelope (`stream`, `seq_num`, `timestamp`, `headers`, `body`) or, with `schema`, typed columns decoded from JSON bodies. Delivery is at-least-once with checkpointed per-stream resume — see the module docs in [`src/sources/s2/mod.rs`](src/sources/s2/mod.rs) for details.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__S2_SOURCE__<KEY>` environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `access_token` | yes | — | S2 access token (env var preferred) |
| `basin` | yes | — | S2 basin name |
| `streams` | one of | — | Exact stream name(s), comma-separated |
| `stream_prefix` | one of | — | Read every stream whose name starts with this prefix |
| `schema` | no | — | Typed mode: `name:type` columns decoded from JSON bodies (`bool`, `int8..64`, `uint8..64`, `float32/64`, `string`, `date`, `timestamp[_s/_ms/_us/_ns]`; `?` suffix = nullable) |
| `include_metadata` | no | `false` | Typed mode: append `_s2_stream`, `_s2_seq_num`, `_s2_timestamp` columns |
| `on_malformed` | no | `error` | Typed mode: `error` fails (and retries) the batch on an undecodable body; `skip` drops it with a WARN |
| `start_position` | no | `earliest` | Where to start any stream with no checkpointed position: `earliest` or `latest`, regardless of when it is discovered |
| `batch_size` | no | `1000` | Max records per generated Arrow batch |
| `update_streams_interval_secs` | no | `60` | How often `stream_prefix` fetches the next page (up to 1,000 streams); removals apply after a complete scan |
| `endpoint` | no | — | Custom S2-compatible endpoint URL (e.g. for s2-lite) |
| `request_timeout_ms` | no | `5000` | Per-request HTTP timeout (ms) |

### CloudTrail Source (`cloudtrail_source`)

Polls the AWS CloudTrail [LookupEvents API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/APIReference/API_LookupEvents.html)
and emits management events with an Athena-style typed schema: scalar columns
(`event_id`, `event_time`, `event_name`, `event_source`, ...) plus raw-JSON
string columns for nested fields (`user_identity`, `request_parameters`, ...).
No trail, S3 bucket, or SQS queue to set up — the only requirement is the
`cloudtrail:LookupEvents` IAM permission. Delivery is at-least-once with a
checkpointed time watermark; a restart re-emits the `lookback_secs` window —
see the module docs in [`src/sources/cloudtrail/mod.rs`](src/sources/cloudtrail/mod.rs)
for details.

LookupEvents limits apply: management events only, 90-day retention, events
appear with a delivery lag (typically up to 15 minutes), and the 2 req/s
API budget (shared with the console Event history) caps throughput at roughly
50 events/s — high-volume accounts need a trail-based integration instead. One
source covers one region; run one source per region for multi-region coverage.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__CLOUDTRAIL_SOURCE__<KEY>`
environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `region` | no | SDK chain | AWS region |
| `endpoint_url` | no | — | Custom endpoint (e.g. LocalStack) |
| `access_key_id` / `secret_access_key` | no | SDK chain | Static credentials, both-or-neither (env vars preferred); omit to use the default chain |
| `session_token` | no | — | Session token for temporary static credentials |
| `start_time` | no | `now` | Where a source with no checkpoint starts: `now`, `earliest` (full 90-day retention), or an RFC 3339 timestamp |
| `poll_interval_secs` | no | `60` | Delay between poll cycles once caught up |
| `lookback_secs` | no | `1800` | How far each cycle re-scans behind its watermark to catch late-delivered events; events delivered later than this are lost |
| `max_window_secs` | no | `3600` | Max span of one poll window (bounds backfill memory); must be > `lookback_secs` |
| `batch_size` | no | `1024` | Max records per generated Arrow batch |
| `lookup_attribute_key` / `lookup_attribute_value` | no | — | Server-side filter, both-or-neither; key is one of `EventId`, `EventName`, `ReadOnly`, `Username`, `ResourceType`, `ResourceName`, `EventSource`, `AccessKeyId` (case-insensitive) |
| `on_malformed` | no | `error` | `error` fails (and retries) the poll cycle on an unparsable event; `skip` drops it with a WARN |

Tip: management events are dominated by reads. Set `lookup_attribute_key: ReadOnly`
with `lookup_attribute_value: "false"` to keep only mutating API calls and cut
most of the noise server-side.

### Postgres CDC Source (`postgres_cdc_source`)

Streams Postgres logical-replication changes (an initial table copy followed by
continuous CDC) by embedding the [`supabase/etl`](https://github.com/supabase/etl)
pipeline. One source instance replicates exactly one table. The output is the
table's own typed columns plus a `_gs_op` column (`i` = insert/copy, `u` =
update, `d` = delete) — no CDC envelope. Sinks should upsert by primary key and
delete on `_gs_op = "d"`; delivery is at-least-once, so replays are idempotent.

Sources that share a `slot_name` share one replication slot and one etl pipeline
(coordinated fan-out and acks); give each source its own `slot_name` otherwise.

**Before-images.** By default an `UPDATE` emits only its new image, which is all
an upserting sink needs. Aggregating sinks need more: to keep a running total
correct they have to subtract what the row used to contribute before adding what
it contributes now. Setting `emit_update_before_row: true` precedes each update's
new image with a `d` row carrying the old image, so downstream can retract the
prior state. It requires `ALTER TABLE ... REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`; updates that arrive
without a full old image are logged and pass through as the new image alone.
Leave it off for sinks that upsert by primary key — they would see the extra `d`
row as a delete.

**Requirements & caveats:**

- **Postgres >= 14** and `wal_level = logical` (Postgres 13 does not work).
- The connecting role needs specific privileges; see **Permissions** below.
- **Schema evolution is not supported.** The output schema is fixed at startup
  from the table's columns; columns added later are dropped, dropped columns
  become null, and type/constraint changes are not applied. Recreate the source
  after DDL.
- `UPDATE`/`DELETE` carry a full old-row image only with
  `ALTER TABLE ... REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`; the default emits key-only images for
  deletes (and unchanged-TOAST columns are null on updates).
- **Metadata storage:** etl's replication state (table schemas, sync progress,
  slot state) is persisted via Streamling's configured state backend, keyed by
  `slot_name`. Durability follows that backend: an in-memory backend loses etl
  state on restart, which re-runs the initial table copy (at-least-once; the
  replication slot itself persists in Postgres). etl also installs an `etl`
  schema (helper functions + a DDL trigger) in the source database on start.
- **Memory backpressure can stall live changes.** etl pauses its replication
  apply stream while *system-wide* memory use exceeds
  `memory_backpressure_activate_threshold` (default 85%), resuming only once it
  drops below `memory_backpressure_resume_threshold` (default 75%). On hosts that
  sit above the resume threshold — common on local/dev machines where reported memory 
  use stays high — the stream stays paused, so live changes stop arriving after 
  the initial copy. Set `memory_backpressure_enabled: false` to turn it off for 
  local/dev, or raise the thresholds.

**Permissions**

The connecting role needs the `REPLICATION` attribute (for logical replication)
and `SELECT` on the replicated table (for the initial copy). Because
`auto_create_publication` is on by default, the role must also be able to
create/alter the publication and etl's metadata schema: grant `CREATE` on the
database, and the role must **own** the replicated table(s) — only the owner
(or a superuser) can add a table to a publication. Example least-privilege
setup:

```sql
-- A login role with the REPLICATION attribute.
CREATE ROLE cdc_user WITH LOGIN REPLICATION PASSWORD 'change-me';

-- Run these in the database you replicate from:
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE mydb TO cdc_user;
GRANT USAGE  ON SCHEMA public TO cdc_user;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE public.users TO cdc_user;   -- initial table copy
GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE mydb TO cdc_user;         -- publication + etl schema

-- The role must own the table to add it to a publication. Either create the
-- table as cdc_user, or transfer ownership:
ALTER TABLE public.users OWNER TO cdc_user;
```

If the role can't own the tables (or you'd rather manage the publication
yourself), create the publication with a privileged role and set
`auto_create_publication: false`.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__POSTGRES_CDC_SOURCE__<KEY>`
environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| `username` | yes | — | Role with `REPLICATION` |
| `password` | no | — | Postgres password (env var preferred) |
| `port` | no | `5432` | Postgres port |
| `publication_name` | yes | — | Logical-replication publication (auto-created by default; disable with `auto_create_publication: false`) |
| `table` | yes | — | Replicated table, `schema.name` (bare names default to `public`) |
| `slot_name` | yes | — | Replication-slot group key; sources sharing it share one slot |
| `auto_create_publication` | no | `true` | Create the publication if missing and add any registered tables not yet in it (needs CREATE on the DB + table ownership) |
| `emit_update_before_row` | no | `false` | Precede each update's new image with a `d` row carrying the old image, for sinks that retract prior state. Requires `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` |
| `tls_enabled` | no | `false` | Require TLS |
| `trusted_root_certs` | no | — | PEM-encoded CA bundle |
| `batch_max_fill_ms` | no | `1000` | etl batch fill window |
| `batch_max_bytes` | no | `8388608` | etl batch byte budget |
| `max_table_sync_workers` | no | `4` | Parallel initial-copy workers |
| `batch_size` | no | `1000` | Max rows per generated output batch |
| `batch_interval_ms` | no | `100` | Max wait for the first row of a batch |
| `max_buffered_units` | no | `8` | Bounded in-flight write-unit buffer |

| `memory_backpressure_resume_threshold` | no | `0.75` | System-memory ratio below which backpressure releases; must be `<` the activate threshold (ignored when disabled) |

### Zama Decrypt Transform (`zama_decrypt`)

Decodes ERC-7984 `ConfidentialTransfer` logs and decrypts their amounts through the Zama SDK daemon, on behalf of wallets that delegated decryption rights on-chain to the plugin's own signing key. Each input row is read as a raw EVM log (`address`, `topic0` to `topic3`); matching rows get seven nullable text columns appended (`zama_token`, `zama_from`, `zama_to`, `zama_handle`, `zama_amount`, `zama_delegator`, `zama_error`), other rows pass through with them null. See the module docs in [`src/transforms/zama_decrypt/mod.rs`](src/transforms/zama_decrypt/mod.rs) for the row flow, failure semantics, output columns, metrics and deployment requirements.

All YAML options can also be set via `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__ZAMA_DECRYPT__<KEY>` environment variables (uppercase key). Env vars take precedence over YAML.

| YAML option | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chain_id` | yes | — | EVM chain id |
| `rpc_url` | yes | — | JSON-RPC endpoint the daemon uses for public reads |
| `daemon_socket` | yes | — | Absolute path of the daemon Unix socket |
| `delegate_private_key` | yes | — | Key of the address wallets delegate to (env var preferred) |
| `relayer_api_key` | no | — | Zama relayer credential (env var preferred) |
| `derivation_secret` | no | — | At-rest wrapping of the transport key pair, 64+ characters (env var preferred) |
| `tokens` | no | all | Comma-separated token contracts to decode |
| `address_column` | no | `address` | Log address column, hex string |
| `topic0_column` to `topic3_column` | no | `topic0` to `topic3` | Log topic columns, hex strings |
| `max_concurrency` | no | SDK default | Relayer concurrency for batch decryption |
| `relayer_debug` | no | `false` | Daemon prints relayer requests to stdout (diagnostic only) |
| `credential_storage` | no | `memory` | `memory` or `persistent` |
| `credential_store_name` | no | `zama_decrypt` | Daemon store name when persistent |

Requirements and caveats:

- Needs a running Zama SDK daemon (`packages/sdk-daemon` in [zama-ai/sdk](https://github.com/zama-ai/sdk), built from the commit pinned in `Cargo.toml`) reachable over a Unix socket. Streamling must run as the same UID as the daemon; the socket grants the same access as the credential store.
- The delegate key signs decryption permits only and needs no funds; use one key per tenant, since every wallet delegating to the same address is decryptable by the same pipeline.
- Rows the relayer or ACL refuses carry the reason in `zama_error` and are not retried. A daemon that cannot be reached fails the batch and the session is rebuilt.
- Streamling logs plugin options at startup, so prefer env vars for the credentials.
- The SDK client is a git dependency on a pinned, unreleased commit; it is bumped together with the daemon image.

### Quick start

```bash
just check    # verify compilation
just lint     # fmt + clippy
just test     # unit tests
just build    # debug build (.so / .dylib)
```

### Building

```bash
just build-release   # release build
```

The project compiles as a shared library that Streamling loads at runtime via the `STREAMLING__PLUGIN__PATH` environment variable.
